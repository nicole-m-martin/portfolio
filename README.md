#### 2/11/2022

- Refactored Giphy component into separate files, to use the [Separation of Concerns(SoC)](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/separation-of-concerns-essential-javascript-1e30994fa7a5) concept with custom hooks, services, and components.

#### 2/10/2022

- I want to add gifs to my homepage to have more fun and use the Giphy API. Created a profile on Giphy developers and obtained my API Key. Wrote a Giphy component to render gifs.

#### 2/7/2022

- Created a Refactor Branch and started to refactor the TailwindCSS to be more readable. I know the point of TailwindCSS is to use inline styling and not separate CSS files, but it looks cluttered and messy so I created a variable 'styles' to extract TailwindCSS to the bottom of each file.
