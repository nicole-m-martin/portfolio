            My name is <span className="font-black ">Nicole Martin</span>, and I
            love creating things. From sewing, drawing, crafting to now building
            apps and websites...I love to explore. Puzzles and using my brain is
            fun, and when I told my senior dev friend that, he told me I picked
            a good field. You never stop learning! I found that out quick with
            programming and I am here for it! I love change and finding all the
            good in Tech. I believe that there is room for everyone and I'm
            excited to be a part of building the future.
